# MITx_6.86x_Project1_Sentiment_Analysis
This project belong to MITx: Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning course.

The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

### The following tasks are completed:
1. Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

2. Use the classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

3. Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.
